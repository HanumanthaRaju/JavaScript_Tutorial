# What is JavaScript?
Programming language designed to interact with web pages, In Web browsers, JavaScript mainly consists of three parts:
1. ECMA Script- Provides core functionlaity
2. Document Object model (DOM)- provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
3. Browser Object Model(BOM)- provides browser API for interacting with web browser

JS adds interactivity, uses HTML and CSS to enhance web page functionality for validating forms, creating interactive maps and displaying animated charts.

Basically when web page is loaded, i.e when HTML and CSS have been downloaded, JavaScript Engine in the web browser executes the JavaScript code, The JavaScript code modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.

JS engine is a program that executes JS code, Earlier JS engine were interpreters, Now JS Engines are implemented as just-in-time compilers to improve performance.

# Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript
Client-side: When JavaScript used on a web page, executed in browsers

Server-Side: Runs o both web browsers and servers, Node.js is one popular server side environment, Server-side Javascript executes on the server that allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.
When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in web browsers. In this case, JavaScript works as a client-side language.

JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular JavaScript server-side environment is Node.js. Unlike client-side JavaScript, server-side JavaScript executes on the server that allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.

# JavaScript History
JavaScript was created by Netscape developer Brendan Eich, first named as Mocha, then to LiveScript, later Netscape decided to change it to JavaScript just before they released its Netscape browser product Netscape Navigator 2, which was JavaScript version 1.0.

Netscape released JavaScript 1.1, also Microsoft released a web browser called Internet Explorer(IE), called JScript.

Two different JS versions were in the market: JavaScript in Netscape Navigator and JScript in Internet Explorer

Hence, two different JavaScript versions were in the market:

JS had no standards governed for its syntax and features, so community decided to standardize the language, after several decisions, the International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commissions (ISO/IEC) adopted ECMAScript (ISO/IEC-16262).
