# JavaScript Fundamentals

Here we will learn about JavaScript syntax, including whitespace, statements, identifiers, comments, expressions, and keywords.

# Whitespace
Refers to characters with a space between other characters, JS has whitespaces related to: Carriage return, Space, New line, Tab.
JS Engine ignores the whitespace, but the usage of whitespace is recommended to enhance the readability and manitainance of the code with a proper indentation.

An Example showcasing the use of Whitespaces in coding:

JS bundlers remove all whitesoaces and puts them in a single file for deployment, this way bundlers make JS code lighter and faster in web browsers
