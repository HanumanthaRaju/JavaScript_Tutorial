### Summary
1. Unary operators work on one value.
2. Unary plus (+) or minus (-) converts a non-numeric value into a number. The unary minus negates the value after the conversion.
3. The prefix increment operator adds one to a value. The value is changed before the statement is evaluted.
4. The postfix increment operator adds one to a value. The value is changed after the statement is evaluted.
5. The prefix decrement operator subtracts one from a value. The value is changed before the statement is evaluted.
6. The postfix decrement operator subtracts one from a value. The value is changed after the statement is evaluted
