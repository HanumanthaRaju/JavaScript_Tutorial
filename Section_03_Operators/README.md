### JavaScript Operators with Objects

If a value is an object, the JavaScript engine will call the valueOf() method of the object to get the value for calculation.

If the object doesnâ€™t have the valueOf() method but has the toString() method, the JavaScript engine will call the toString() method to get the value for calculation.

### Summary
Use the JavaScript arithmetic operators including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiply (*) and divide (/) to perform arithmetic opeations.

### Summary
1. Unary operators work on one value.
2. Unary plus (+) or minus (-) converts a non-numeric value into a number. The unary minus negates the value after the conversion.
3. The prefix increment operator adds one to a value. The value is changed before the statement is evaluted.
4. The postfix increment operator adds one to a value. The value is changed after the statement is evaluted.
5. The prefix decrement operator subtracts one from a value. The value is changed before the statement is evaluted.
6. The postfix decrement operator subtracts one from a value. The value is changed after the statement is evaluted

### Logical Operator Precedence
The precedence of the logical operator is in the following order from the highest to the lowest:

1. Logical NOT (!)
2. Logical AND (&&)
3. Logical OR (||)

### Summary
1. The NOT operator (!) negates a boolean value. The (!!) converts a value into its real boolean value.
2. The AND operator (&&) is applied to two Boolean values and returns true if both values are true.
3. The OR operator (||) is applied to two Boolean values and returns true if one of the operands is true.
4. Both && and || operator are short-circuited. They can be also applied to non-Boolean values.
5. The logical operator precedence from the highest to the lowest is !, && and ||
